# Overview of Stock Analysis Project
    The purpose of this specific stock analysis challenge was to refactor our initial code we used during the module. 
    The module allowed us to analyze a dozen stocks at a time using VBA - allowing for quicker analysis overall. 
    After completing the module, the initial code could have benefitted from refactoring.
    So, as a result, I refactored the code allowing for a faster return after running the subroutine. 

# Results
    The refactored code for the year 2018 resulted in a faster return time. Screenshots are available in Github. 
    However, I struggle understanding how much actual "refactoring" we did to the original code. 
    The biggest change to the code was the use of the tickerIndex variable. 

# Advantages
    The advantage of refactoring code is that it results in cleaner code overall. This allows the macro to run faster. 
    Refactoring code can lead to more of a simple understanding of what is going on if another person were to look at it. 

# Disadvantages
    I discovered the disadvantages of refactoring code. One of which was that it can be time-consuming.
    At various times throughout the challenge, I started questioning what I had done in the original code which led to confusion when I want to adjust it. 
    Another disadvantage is that it can "dumb" the code down too much - leading to others not understanding the code. 
    Adding comments along the way is crucial.
